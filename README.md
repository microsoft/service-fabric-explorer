# Service Fabric Explorer (SFX)

NOTE: Sfx is currently in the process of migrating from angularjs(Sfx v1) to angular 10(Sfx v2). The Sfx folder holds the previous version and SfxWeb is the new version. While this migration is happening, Sfx v1 will still be available but once Sfx v2 is considered safe and has 100% parity with V1 will be removed and official deprecated. All new development is being focused on V2 and unless its a critical bug with V1, V1 will not be getting any continued support.

Service Fabric Explorer is an application for inspecting and managing cloud applications and nodes in a Microsoft Azure Service Fabric cluster.

## Developer Help and Documentation

Service Fabric Explorer consists of two main components, an AngularJS based application (Sfx) and an Electron part to host the AngularJS application (Sfx-Standalone).

### Preparing the development machine

To develop Service Fabric Explorer, the following components are required.

* Git: https://git-scm.com/
* Node.js (Latest is preferred): https://nodejs.org/

The recommended IDE for Service Fabric Explorer development is VSCode because VSCode is a cross-platform editor, which supports Windows, Linux and macOS. But you can use whatever editor to develop. 

Here's a list of common IDE used.
* VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
* Visual Studio: https://www.visualstudio.com/

### Set up the development environment

1. Clone the master branch.
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-explorer.git <path to the local folder>`
2. Install project dependencies: *This can be done inside VSCode or use a console window.*
   1. [SFX] install the following [CLI](https://angular.io/cli) for the angular project 
   ```Shell
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
   1. [SFX] Navigate to `src/SfxWeb` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install   
   ```

   1. [SFX Proxy] Navigate to `src/Sfx-Proxy` and run the following scripts.
   ```Shell
   npm install   
   ```

3. Build projects
   * VSCode
      1. Open `src/SfxWeb` and `src/Sfx-Proxy` in VSCode with multiple-root workspce.
   * Console
      1. [SFX] Navigate to `src/SfxWeb` and run the following scripts.
      For a develop/quick build
      ```Shell
      npm run build
      ```
      For a production build
      ```
      npm run build:prod
      ```

### Develop Locally and Run Local Proxy
Navigate to `src/SfxWeb`
```Shell
npm start
```
Navigate to `src/Sfx-Proxy`
```Shell
npm start
```

There are 2 optional flags
-r which would record every request to a folder(by default called playbackRecordings) and overwriting if the same request is made again
-p every request will be checked for a saved response and if one exists get served instead
```Shell
npm start -- -r -p
```

If proxying requests to a secure cluster adding a file called localsettings.json to src/Sfx-Proxy can take a cert pfx location like below.
```
{
  "TargetCluster": {
    "Url": "https://test.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080",
    "PFXLocation": "C:/some_cert.pfx",
    "PFXPassPhrase": "password"
  },
  "recordFileBase": "playbackRecordings/"
}
```


## Testing

### Run unit tests
Navigate to  `src/SfxWeb` folder and run 
```
npm test
```

### Run E2E tests
Navigate to src/SfxWeb folder and run
```
npm run cypress:local
```
This assumes that the angular local dev server is running

### Generate test coverage report
(see the following for reference https://lukas-klement.medium.com/implementing-code-coverage-with-angular-and-cypress-6ed08ed7e617)

Run a full E2E suite above and this will generate a code coverage report.
Navigate to src/SfxWeb folder and run
```
npm run test:coverage
```
Then you can also view a full report at
```
sfxWeb/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### CI overview
The CI will run the following

* production build
* unit tests
* E2E tests
